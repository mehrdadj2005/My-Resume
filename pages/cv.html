        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Hello! My name is Mehrdad Jokari and I have been working in the field of programming with great interest for more than 2 years. From the beginning, I was fascinated by web development and creating innovative solutions, which has led me to learn and gain experience in this direction. By working on different projects, I have been able to strengthen my technical and creative skills and continue to grow professionally.</li>
                <li>
                    In addition to programming, I have also become interested in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, and I have been specially trained in this field for 6 months. This course has helped me to look at design from the user's point of view and provide beautiful and user-friendly solutions.
